  { id: 'g0', dayIndex: 0, title: 'Welcome to Fatherhood', body: 'Today is day one. Your baby needs three things right now: warmth, food, and you. Hold them skin-to-skin whenever you can. Your heartbeat is the most familiar sound in their world.' },
  { id: 'g1', dayIndex: 1, title: 'Diaper Basics', body: 'Expect 6-8 wet diapers a day once milk comes in. Dark, tar-like stool (meconium) is normal for the first few days. It will transition to yellow or green.' },
  { id: 'g2', dayIndex: 2, title: 'Supporting Your Partner', body: 'Recovery after birth is intense. Take on diaper duty, bring water and snacks during feedings, and handle visitors. Your partner needs rest more than anything.' },
  { id: 'g3', dayIndex: 3, title: 'Sleep in Shifts', body: 'Neither of you will get a full night\'s sleep for a while. Try sleeping in shifts - you take the first stretch, your partner takes the second. Even 3-4 hours of uninterrupted sleep helps enormously.' },
  { id: 'g4', dayIndex: 4, title: 'Crying Is Communication', body: 'Babies cry to communicate. Run through the checklist: hungry? wet diaper? too hot/cold? needs burping? wants to be held? You\'ll start recognizing different cries soon.' },
  { id: 'g5', dayIndex: 5, title: 'Burping Techniques', body: 'Try three positions: over your shoulder, sitting on your lap with chin supported, or face-down on your lap. Pat gently on the back. Some babies need burping mid-feed too.' },
  { id: 'g6', dayIndex: 6, title: 'Your First Week Done', body: 'You survived week one. That\'s huge. By now you\'ve probably changed dozens of diapers and lost count of feedings. You\'re building confidence every single day.' },
  { id: 'g7', dayIndex: 7, title: 'Tummy Time Starts Now', body: 'Start with 1-2 minutes of tummy time a few times a day. Place baby on your chest if they resist the floor. This builds neck and shoulder strength.' },
  { id: 'g8', dayIndex: 8, title: 'Bath Time Tips', body: 'Until the umbilical cord stump falls off, use sponge baths. Keep the room warm, have everything ready before you start, and never leave baby unattended near water.' },
  { id: 'g9', dayIndex: 9, title: 'Track Feeding Patterns', body: 'Newborns eat every 2-3 hours. Look for hunger cues: rooting, sucking on hands, lip smacking. Crying is a late hunger sign.' },
  { id: 'g10', dayIndex: 10, title: 'The Umbilical Cord', body: 'Keep the cord stump clean and dry. Fold diapers below it. It usually falls off within 1-3 weeks. Don\'t pull it - let it happen naturally.' },
  { id: 'g11', dayIndex: 11, title: 'Swaddling Like a Pro', body: 'A good swaddle can calm a fussy baby instantly. Arms snug, hips loose. Stop swaddling once baby starts trying to roll (usually around 2 months).' },
  { id: 'g12', dayIndex: 12, title: 'Check In With Yourself', body: 'Dads can experience postpartum mood changes too. Feeling overwhelmed, anxious, or disconnected is normal. Talk to someone you trust about how you\'re feeling.' },
  { id: 'g13', dayIndex: 13, title: 'Safe Sleep Basics', body: 'Always place baby on their back to sleep. Firm, flat surface. No loose blankets, pillows, or stuffed animals in the crib. Room-sharing (not bed-sharing) is recommended.' },
  { id: 'g14', dayIndex: 14, title: 'Two Weeks In', body: 'Your baby is starting to be more alert during wake windows. They can focus on objects 8-12 inches away - about the distance to your face when you hold them. Talk to them often.' },
  { id: 'g15', dayIndex: 15, title: 'Growth Spurts', body: 'Growth spurts happen around 2 weeks, 3 weeks, and 6 weeks. Baby will want to eat more frequently and may be fussier. This is temporary and normal.' },
  { id: 'g16', dayIndex: 16, title: 'Soothing the 5 S\'s', body: 'Dr. Harvey Karp\'s 5 S\'s: Swaddle, Side/Stomach position (while holding), Shush, Swing, Suck. These mimic the womb and can calm most crying babies.' },
  { id: 'g17', dayIndex: 17, title: 'Bonding Through Touch', body: 'Infant massage is a powerful bonding tool. Use gentle strokes on legs, arms, and belly. It can help with gas, sleep, and your connection.' },
  { id: 'g18', dayIndex: 18, title: 'When to Call the Doctor', body: 'Call if: fever over 100.4F (rectal), refusing to eat, fewer than 6 wet diapers/day, unusual rash, excessive crying that won\'t stop, or anything that feels wrong to you. Trust your instincts.' },
  { id: 'g19', dayIndex: 19, title: 'Reading to Your Baby', body: 'It\'s never too early to read aloud. Your baby loves the sound of your voice. High-contrast board books are great for newborns whose vision is still developing.' },
  { id: 'g20', dayIndex: 20, title: 'Handling Unsolicited Advice', body: 'Everyone has opinions about babies. Take what helps, ignore what doesn\'t. You and your partner know your baby best. It\'s okay to set boundaries.' },
  { id: 'g21', dayIndex: 21, title: 'Three Weeks Strong', body: 'By now you\'re developing your own rhythm. You might notice your baby starting to have slightly more predictable eat-sleep cycles. Keep going.' },
  { id: 'g22', dayIndex: 22, title: 'Bottle Feeding Tips', body: 'Hold baby semi-upright. Pace the feeding - let them take breaks. Tilt the bottle so the nipple is full of milk, not air. Burp halfway through.' },
  { id: 'g23', dayIndex: 23, title: 'Getting Outside', body: 'Fresh air is good for everyone. Even a short walk around the block helps your mood and can soothe a fussy baby. Dress baby in one more layer than you\'re wearing.' },
  { id: 'g24', dayIndex: 24, title: 'Recognizing Gas', body: 'Signs of gas: pulling legs up, arching back, squirming during/after feeds. Try bicycle legs, gentle tummy massage in clockwise circles, or holding baby in a \"football hold.\"' },
  { id: 'g25', dayIndex: 25, title: 'Night Feeding Strategy', body: 'Keep night feeds calm and boring. Low lights, minimal talking, quick diaper change. This helps baby learn the difference between day and night.' },
  { id: 'g26', dayIndex: 26, title: 'Your Baby\'s Senses', body: 'Newborns can smell you, hear your voice from across the room, and see your face up close. They prefer high-contrast patterns and the sound of human voices over any toy.' },
  { id: 'g27', dayIndex: 27, title: 'Preparing for Visitors', body: 'Ask visitors to wash hands before holding baby. It\'s okay to limit visit length. If you need to cancel because baby or family needs rest, that\'s perfectly fine.' },
  { id: 'g28', dayIndex: 28, title: 'One Month Milestone', body: 'Congratulations - you made it through the first month. Your baby may start to smile socially soon. Those first real smiles are incredible and worth every sleepless night.' },
  { id: 'g29', dayIndex: 29, title: 'Tummy Time Progress', body: 'Aim for 10-15 minutes of tummy time spread throughout the day. Baby might lift their head briefly now. Use a rolled towel under their chest if they struggle.' },
  { id: 'g30', dayIndex: 30, title: 'Managing Sleep Deprivation', body: 'Sleep when baby sleeps isn\'t always practical, but rest when you can. Caffeine helps but stop by early afternoon. Nap for 20 minutes if possible - it makes a real difference.' },
  { id: 'g31', dayIndex: 31, title: 'Baby\'s First Sounds', body: 'Listen for coos and gurgles. These are early attempts at communication. Respond with enthusiasm - this back-and-forth is the foundation of language development.' },
  { id: 'g32', dayIndex: 32, title: 'Diaper Rash Prevention', body: 'Change diapers frequently. Let baby air-dry before putting on a fresh one. Use a barrier cream at every change. If rash persists or looks unusual, call your pediatrician.' },
  { id: 'g33', dayIndex: 33, title: 'Finding Your Dad Style', body: 'There\'s no one right way to be a dad. Maybe you\'re the calm one, the silly one, the organized one. Your unique strengths are exactly what your baby needs.' },
  { id: 'g34', dayIndex: 34, title: 'Partner Check-In', body: 'Ask your partner how they\'re really doing. Listen without trying to fix. Sometimes just being heard is enough. Schedule time together, even if it\'s just 15 minutes.' },
  { id: 'g35', dayIndex: 35, title: 'Five Weeks', body: 'Your baby is becoming more interactive. Longer alert periods, more eye contact, beginning to track objects with their eyes. Enjoy these moments of connection.' },
  { id: 'g36', dayIndex: 36, title: 'Car Seat Safety', body: 'Baby should be rear-facing. Harness straps should be at or below shoulder level. The chest clip sits at armpit level. No puffy coats under the harness.' },
  { id: 'g37', dayIndex: 37, title: 'Cluster Feeding', body: 'Some evenings, baby will want to eat constantly for hours. This is called cluster feeding and it\'s completely normal. It usually happens in the evening and helps build milk supply.' },
  { id: 'g38', dayIndex: 38, title: 'Baby Wearing', body: 'A good baby carrier frees your hands and keeps baby close. Make sure baby\'s face is visible, chin off chest, and airways clear. Many dads find carriers more practical than strollers.' },
  { id: 'g39', dayIndex: 39, title: 'Tracking Milestones', body: 'Every baby develops at their own pace. Don\'t compare to other babies. Focus on whether your baby is progressing, not hitting exact dates. Your pediatrician will guide you.' },
  { id: 'g40', dayIndex: 40, title: 'Witching Hour', body: 'Many babies have a fussy period in the late afternoon/evening. Try the 5 S\'s, go for a drive, or take turns with your partner. It peaks around 6 weeks and usually improves by 3 months.' },
  { id: 'g41', dayIndex: 41, title: 'Building a Routine', body: 'Strict schedules don\'t work with newborns, but gentle routines help. Consistent bedtime rituals (dim lights, bath, feeding, song) signal to baby that sleep is coming.' },
  { id: 'g42', dayIndex: 42, title: 'Six Weeks', body: 'The six-week mark is often when things start to click. You\'re reading baby\'s cues better, feeding feels more natural, and you might see that first social smile. You\'re doing great.' },
  { id: 'g43', dayIndex: 43, title: 'Postpartum Checkup', body: 'Your partner likely has their postpartum checkup around now. Offer to go along. Ask about your own mental health too - many clinics welcome dads for screening.' },
  { id: 'g44', dayIndex: 44, title: 'Baby\'s Vision', body: 'By 6 weeks, baby can see about 18 inches away and is starting to recognize faces. They\'re drawn to high-contrast patterns and bold colors. Black and white toys are great right now.' },
  { id: 'g45', dayIndex: 45, title: 'Taking Photos & Videos', body: 'Capture everyday moments, not just posed photos. Bath time, tummy time, sleeping faces. You\'ll treasure the ordinary moments as much as the milestones.' },
  { id: 'g46', dayIndex: 46, title: 'Returning to Work', body: 'If you\'re heading back to work, plan the transition. Prep meals, establish morning and evening routines, and stay connected during the day with photos or video calls.' },
  { id: 'g47', dayIndex: 47, title: 'Dealing with Spit-Up', body: 'Frequent spit-up is normal - it\'s not the same as vomiting. Keep baby upright for 20-30 minutes after feeding. A burp cloth on your shoulder becomes your best accessory.' },
  { id: 'g48', dayIndex: 48, title: 'Social Smiling', body: 'Around this time, baby starts smiling in response to your face and voice. This isn\'t gas - it\'s genuine social interaction. Smile back and watch the connection grow.' },
  { id: 'g49', dayIndex: 49, title: 'Seven Weeks', body: 'You\'re almost two months in. Your baby is growing fast - check the weight gain at your next pediatrician visit. Healthy weight gain is the best indicator that feeding is going well.' },
  { id: 'g50', dayIndex: 50, title: 'Establishing Daytime Naps', body: 'Watch for sleepy cues: yawning, rubbing eyes, looking away. Most babies this age can handle 45-90 minutes of awake time before needing a nap.' },
  { id: 'g51', dayIndex: 51, title: 'Singing to Your Baby', body: 'You don\'t need a good voice. Babies love the rhythm and vibration of your singing. Lullabies, favorite songs, even narrating what you\'re doing in a sing-song voice.' },
  { id: 'g52', dayIndex: 52, title: 'Accepting Help', body: 'When people offer to help, say yes. Let them bring a meal, hold the baby while you shower, or run an errand. Accepting help isn\'t weakness - it\'s smart parenting.' },
  { id: 'g53', dayIndex: 53, title: 'Baby\'s Grip Reflex', body: 'Notice how baby grips your finger? This is the palmar grasp reflex. It\'s one of several newborn reflexes that will gradually give way to intentional movement.' },
  { id: 'g54', dayIndex: 54, title: 'Keeping the House Running', body: 'Lower your standards temporarily. Dishes can wait. Laundry will pile up. Focus on keeping everyone fed, rested, and safe. Everything else is bonus.' },
  { id: 'g55', dayIndex: 55, title: 'Play Ideas for 8 Weeks', body: 'Talk and narrate your day. Make eye contact and funny faces. Slowly move a toy or rattle side to side. Gentle bicycle movements with legs. Sing rhymes with hand motions.' },
  { id: 'g56', dayIndex: 56, title: 'Eight Weeks - Two Months', body: 'Happy two-month birthday! Your baby is likely cooing, following objects with their eyes, and holding their head up briefly. The first vaccinations are usually around now.' },
  { id: 'g57', dayIndex: 57, title: 'Vaccination Day', body: 'Baby may be fussy after vaccines. Gentle cuddles, feeding, and infant-appropriate pain relief (ask your doctor first) can help. A warm bath may soothe them too.' },
  { id: 'g58', dayIndex: 58, title: 'Date Night Planning', body: 'Even a simple at-home date night matters. Order food, put the baby down, and spend time together. Your relationship needs attention too - it\'s the foundation of your family.' },
  { id: 'g59', dayIndex: 59, title: 'Looking Ahead', body: 'The hardest part of the newborn phase is behind you. Smiles are coming more often, routines are forming, and you\'re becoming the dad your baby needs. Trust yourself. You\'ve got this.' },
